To start the project open the solution named Lab8.sln and run it.
A local hosted web page will be produced and when accesing it will result in a log in page. 

The following credentials result in both user type views:

Customer Cedentials: 
  Username: "Customer"
  Password: "Admin123!"

(Once done with testing the customer hit logout in the top right)

 Manager Credentials: 
  Username: "Manager"
  Password: "Admin123!"
 
 Both logins will result in different layout pages with navigation on the top bar for accessing all different componenets of the application. For designing the controlles I had a total of 3, one for deciding views to be presented to user based on role, and two for all things relating to Customer or Manager users
