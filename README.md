Customer Cedentials
  Username: "Customer"
  Password: "Admin123!"
 
 Manager Credentials
  Username: "Manager"
  Password: "Admin123!"
 
 Both logins will result in different layout pages with navigation on the top bar for accessing all different componenets of the application. For designing the controlles I had a total of 3, one for deciding views to be presented to user based on role, and two for all things relating to Customer or Manager users
